						<p>Through Earth's geologic time, the atmosphere went through many changes. The Great Oxidation
							Event is one of the most significant events in Earth History. This geologic event occured
							about 2.35 billion years ago when Earth went from having no oxygen to having a small amount
							of oxygen. </p>

				<h3>Archean Timeline</h3>

				<img src="images/archean.png" alt="Oxygen" class="image.fit" width=55%>
				<p>Earth's early atmosphere mainly consisted of water vapor, carbon dioxide, nitrogen, carbon monoxide,
					hydrogen sulfied, and hydrogen chloride. The Earth's atmosphere became oxygenated by the
					Proterozoic, which began 2.5 billion years ago. Multicellular life appear in the fossil record 1.8
					billion years ago following the influx in oxygen levels. </p>

				<h3>O<sub>2</sub> Levels in the Atmosphere</h3>
				<p> </p>
				<img src="images/oxygenation.svg" alt="Oxygen" class="image.fit" width=45%>
				<p> </p>
				<p>O<sub>2</sub> build up in the Earth's atmosphere has been described to be split into four stages.
				</p>
				<p>
					Stage 1: 3.85–2.45 BYA Absence of O<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere and the oceans
					<br>
					Stage 2: 2.45–1.85 BYA O<sub>2</sub> began being produced but was mainly absorbed into the ocean
					<br>
					Stage 3: 1.85–0.85 BYA O<sub>2</sub> began releasing from the ocean but was mainly absorbed into
					land
					<br>
					Stage 4: 0.85 BYA–Present O<sub>2</sub> filled the atmosphere

					<p>The Archean Eon which began 4.6 billion years ago, is the oldest unit of time on the geological
						time scale. Life began to evolve from oceans, plate tectonic activity, continents, and
						proliferation of prokaryote bacteria. During this time, early bacteria and stromatolites formed.

				<h3>Cyanobacteria</h3>

				<img src="images/cyanobacteria.png" alt="Cyanobacteria" class="image.fit" width=30%>
				<p>Cyanobacteria is blue-green algae from the ocean that produces free oxygen as a waste product into
					the ocean via photosynthesis. This oxygen build up in the oceans eventually filled the atmosphere
					which marked the beginning of the Great Oxygenation Event. Cyanobacteria enabled the diversification
					of multicellular life forms. However, cyanobacteria is an anaerobic
					organism which means it flourishes from the absence of oxygen. As oxygen levels increased, the
					amount of anaerobic organisms decreased and caused an event known as the "oxygen crisis".
					O<sub>2</sub> levels were fluctuating during this time, but eventually life evolved and Earth began
					to hold O<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere. </p>

				<h3>Banded Iron Formation</h3>

				<img src="images/bif.png" alt="Banded" class="image.fit" width=30%>
				<p>Banded iron formations are thin bedded sedimentary rocks that first appeared in the Precambrian
					period dating back to nearly 3 billion years ago. As photosynthetic organisms produced oxygen, there
					was a reaction with iron dissolved in seawater and formed iron oxide minerals which are known as
					banded iron formations. This rock formation consists of dark layers of unoxidized iron and bright
					red layers of oxidized iron. Banded iron formations are found all over Earth
					which is evidence that the oxygen levels were fluctuating Earth's atmosphere. </p>
